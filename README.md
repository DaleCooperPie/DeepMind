This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To start the app, run in the project directory:

### `npm start`


The app is available on the http://localhost:3000/home

The idea of the app is to make as little calls to the possibly failing API as possible.
I display the agent overview in a modal instead of a septate page, as I believe it leads to better UX.
The agent comparison is demonstrated on a separate page (partially to demo routing).
Hope you enjoy playing with it as much as I enjoyed making it! :)
